# Python-MySQLConnectivity-Project
This a project for class 12th student. Here I have used python and mysql connectivity to make a responsive online store where one can buy products. A buyer can view,add,delete products whereas a customer can view and purchase product with a bill. We also can view a graph of sales.
I have already shown how to link mysql with python.
There are some commands we need to install before running the code for eg. pip.
